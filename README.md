==========
Inspired by a lesson on CodeAcademy.com.

This is a small project with the goal of teaching the names, features, and facts associated with the planets/moons 
of our solar system.

**Orbital patterns, planet mass, etc. will not be illustrated to scale.

To be coded in JS and CSS with animations done with CSS3. 

Intended for elementary level education/first exposure to astronomy.
